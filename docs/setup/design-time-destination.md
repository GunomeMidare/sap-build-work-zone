> [!Note]
> If version 2 is to be used, create a new* design time destination and include the service endpoint URL <host>/sap/bc/http/ui2/flp_content_exposure/entities.
> Create a new content channel that uses the new design time destination. Since this is an HTTP service, you might need to activate it first in the S/4 system using transaction UCON_HTTP_SERVICES. The name of the service is /UI2/FLP_CONTENT_EXPOSURE.
>
> Make sure that ICF node /sap/bc/http is activated using transaction SICF.
> (*) Do not use the same Design time destination (and content channel) to switch between different exposure versions. This can lead to undesired behaviors during content exposure (i.e. malfunction of the Content Change Notifications).
